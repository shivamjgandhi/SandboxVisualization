    <h1>Ever wanted stats on Sandbox?</h1>
    	<p> I scraped the Sandbox members webpage to gather some of the stats on Sandbox as part of my wow. The purpose of this project is to get a better idea of what the present state of Sandbox is in a nice visual format. I do want to note that the data I was using was limited, as not every member has written a biography or indicated their skillsets, so these visualizations are incomplete. There are also some more interesting stats that I'd like to visualize if I had access to the data. That being said, hope you enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Skillsets</h2>
    	<p>Here's a graph showing what the most common skillsets are from people in Sandbox. I did this by seeing what people write for the "Can Help With" section for their entry and then counting the amount of instances of each skill. Here's a bar graph of the top 20 skills represented in Sandbox:</p>
    	<img src="http://gdurl.com/0NSL" alt="skillsets" width="800" class="center">
    	<p>As we can see, startups and entrepreneurship dominate our skill set, with a total of 34 members saying they are willing to help out with them together. It's very likely that many more members of Sandbox are willing to help out with startups as well, given that we see skills such as design, strategy, and marketing entering the top most common skills that members can help out with.</p>

    	<p>It's also worth noting the prevalence of artistic skills that aren't as downright technical. We had a total of 12 members saying they'd be willing to help with writing, and other skills such as photography and art also are present in the top 20. How about we take a look at the top 50 skills represented in Sandbox?</p>

    	<img src="http://gdurl.com/jvZrV" alt="50 skills" width="800" class="center">

    	<p>Upon extending the graph a bit and seeing what skills people can help out with, we see the trend of techy members who are interested in startups and entrepreneurship continue, with skills such as web development, data analysis, and social entrepreneurship showing up. On the other hand, we have skills such as listening, mindfulness, and psychology making appearences. These skills harken back to Sandbox's mission of encouraging personal and community growth, so it's good to see that these skills are well represented.</p>
