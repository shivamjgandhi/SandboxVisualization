    <h1>Ever wanted stats on Sandbox?</h1>
    	<p> I scraped the Sandbox members webpage to gather some of the stats on Sandbox as part of my wow. The purpose of this project is to get a better idea of what the present state of Sandbox is in a nice visual format. I chose to do this project since I've recently gotten very interested in data visualization and natural language processing, so this project would simultaneously allow me to better my skills while creating something useful for Sandboxers. I do want to note that the data I was using was limited, as not every member has written a biography or indicated their skillsets, so these visualizations are incomplete. There are also some more interesting stats that I'd like to visualize if I had access to the data. That being said, hope you enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Skillsets</h2>
    	<p>Here's a graph showing what the most common skillsets are from people in Sandbox. I did this by seeing what people write for the "Can Help With" section for their entry and then counting the amount of instances of each skill. Here's a bar graph of the top 20 skills represented in Sandbox:</p>
    	<img src="http://gdurl.com/0NSL" alt="skillsets" width="800" class="center">
    	<p>As we can see, startups and entrepreneurship dominate our skill set, with a total of 34 members saying they are willing to help out with them together. It's very likely that many more members of Sandbox are willing to help out with startups as well, given that we see skills such as design, strategy, and marketing entering the top most common skills that members can help out with.</p>

    	<p>It's also worth noting the prevalence of artistic skills that aren't as downright technical. We had a total of 12 members saying they'd be willing to help with writing, and other skills such as photography and art also are present in the top 20. How about we take a look at the top 50 skills represented in Sandbox? You'll have to zoom in to get a look at the finer details. </p>

    	<img src="http://gdurl.com/jvZrV" alt="50 skills" width="800" class="center">

    	<p>Upon extending the graph a bit and seeing what skills people can help out with, we see the trend of techy members who are interested in startups and entrepreneurship continue, with skills such as web development, data analysis, and social entrepreneurship showing up. On the other hand, we have skills such as listening, mindfulness, and psychology making appearances. These skills beckon to Sandbox's mission of encouraging personal and community growth, so it's good to see that these skills are well represented.</p>

    <h2>Career Choices</h2>
    	<p>Careers is a bit of a misnomer here, but it's what people choose to identify themselves as. I scraped this from the bio section of each member. Generally, members wrote about who they are as their first sentences so I counted all of the different "identifications" and the occurrences of each identification and made some bar graphs here, with the top 18 identifications shown:</p>

        <img src="http://gdurl.com/0bvv" alt="18 careers" class="center">

    	<p>Just as we expected given the data from the skillsets, entrepreneurs and founders are the primary represented identification, with a grand total of 101 members identifying as one of the two if not both. It's striking to see that the next most prominent label, creative, comes in at only a count of 20 instances. We see other identifications such as scientist, engineer, and consultant represented here. We also see some fields of interest represented such as education, tech, and business. These all make sense given Sandbox's mission to connect entrepreneurial individuals together, and it seems that the diversity in sub-skillsets such as engineering and writing indicates a healthy mix of skillsets within our community</p>

    <h2>Geographic Distribution</h2>
    	<p>Sandbox is a global community, and here we have the data to back this claim. Below, I've plotted the top 20 locations represented by Sandbox members: </p>

        <img src="http://gdurl.com/MtMu" alt="20 locations" class="center">

        <p>It's interesting to see how represented London is compared to other locations. Perhaps the city will become your next travel destination knowing how many other Sandbox members are located there. However, it's also interesting that hubless and nomad both make the top 5, with a total of 99 members belonging to either "location". I'd be incredibly interested in trying to figure out correlations between skillsets/careers and locations to see if there's a specific correlation for hubless/nomadic members (would love to add this on as a visualization in the future). Overall, we can see that Europe is very well represented by Sandbox members as well as American cities. Perhaps this would motivate expansion of Sandbox into more developing countries so we get more cultural and background diversity. I've shown the top 45 locations below here as well:</p>
